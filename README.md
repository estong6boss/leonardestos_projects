I researched and analyzed real-world cybersecurity incidents, from AI-driven misinformation campaigns to ransomware attacks targeting critical infrastructure. I produced multiple white papers documenting attack vectors, discovery methods, containment strategies, lessons learned, and cost considerations. This experience sharpened my ability to translate complex technical incidents into structured, professional reports aligned with industry standards. I learned to communicate actionable insights in a way that is accessible to technical, executive, and legal audiences.
